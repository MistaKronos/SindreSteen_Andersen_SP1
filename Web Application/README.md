# SindreSteen_Andersen_SP1
Semester Project - Receptionist program


This web application keeps track of staff members and their absence, and also supports a delivery scheduling system that allows users to add, view, and delete scheduled deliveries. It's built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and Bootstrap.

index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web application.
css/style.css: The custom CSS styles for the web application.
js/main.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic and functionality of the web application.
img/: This folder contains any images used in the application.
README.md: The file you're currently reading.

Installation and setup using git:

1. First, you'll need to clone this repository to your office machine. You can do this using git from your command line:
git clone https://github.com/MistaKronos/SindreSteen_Andersen_SP1

2. Open the Web Application folder.

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

This project uses the Bootstrap CSS framework for responsive design. Bootstrap's files have been included in the project, so you don't need to install anything else. However, you should ensure that you have a modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript.

Once you have opened the index.html file in your web browser, you can interact with the application. 
You can click the dashboard on the NAV-BAR to be guided below the NAV-BAR.
You can clock out and clock in staff members, by selecting their row first, and then whichever option you wish to choose. You can even do the "clock-in" through the toast notification that comes up if staff members have not returned on time.
You can add a delivery by filling out the form in the schedule delivery table, and clicking the "Add" button. The added delivery will appear in the table below. To delete a delivery, click on the delivery board row to select it and then click the "Clear" button. You will be prompted first, incase it was a mistake. You will also have the option to clear the row through the toast notification, with the same prompt incase you clicked it on accident. The row in question through the toast, will be the one the toast has stated.

You will need to send me your username on GitHub, so I can set you up on the project, else I can send you all the project files through a method of your choosing, if you don't want to do it through git. 

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact me.
